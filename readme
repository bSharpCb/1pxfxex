Instructions / Context

1. Upon cloning the repository, navigate into the local folder and execute the following commands
  a. npm install
  b. npm run start
2. Initially, you should receive an authorization error. This is because you will need to update 
   the authorization parameter with your API key (line 24 of fox-api-examples.js)
3. Once you've added this, execute 'npm run start' to see the default query in your console


Trying Different Queries

1. Open 'fox-api-examples.js' in any text editor
2. Scroll down to line 193, where you will see four comment blocks, each corresponding to
   a different function/query
3. By default, the query '_Query_iOS_Android_90_days()' is uncommented, on line 199
4. To run any of the other 3 queries, you can comment-out line 199, and uncomment the one you'd like
   to use instead
5. Once again, execute 'npm run start' in the console, and observe the results of your selected query


Overall, the queries provided are meant to demonstrate the available options and flexibility granted
through the API. Hopefully these samples can provide enough context to start building ideas about
the queries you'd like to run. It may be helpful to edit the queries within fox-api-examples.js, so 
you can experiment with different combinations in the Node client. If you have any questions about this,
please let me know and I'll be happy to help.
